//! Recording Session Management
//!
//! This module provides RAII-based session management for recording operations.
//! It ensures that resources (cancel shortcut, mute, overlay) are properly cleaned up
//! regardless of how the recording ends (success, cancel, error, or double-stop).
//!
//! The key insight is that `RecordingSession` is a guard that:
//! - Registers the cancel shortcut on creation
//! - Unregisters it exactly once on Drop
//! - Tracks what resources were acquired to only release what was actually acquired
