# <img src="src/assets/logo.png" alt="S2B2S" width="48" height="48" style="vertical-align: middle" /> S2B2S — SpeechToBrainToSpeech

**Local-first STT → Brain → TTS desktop app for Windows 11. Dictate anywhere, read anything aloud, and talk naturally with a local AI — almost keyboard-free.**

S2B2S is a cross-platform desktop application that combines speech-to-text (STT), a local or cloud "Brain" (LLM), and text-to-speech (TTS) into one unified voice-native experience. Based on the battle-tested [Handy](https://github.com/cjpais/Handy) skeleton (MIT), rebranded and extended toward a full voice conversation pipeline.

## Why S2B2S?

- **Local-first**: Everything works offline. Parakeet V3 for STT, Piper for TTS, Ollama/LM Studio for the Brain. No cloud required.
- **Open Source (MIT)**: Forkable, inspectable, extendable.
- **Private**: Your voice, text, and conversations stay on your machine.
- **Voice-native**: Designed for spoken interaction — not a text chat with voice bolted on.

## How It Works

1. **Dictate Anywhere** — press a hotkey, speak, and polished text lands at your cursor. Powered by **Parakeet V3** (default, local, 25 languages with auto-detection).
2. **Read Aloud** — select text anywhere, press a hotkey, and a local voice reads it instantly with pause/resume.
3. **Talk to the Brain** — the Conversation window: speak naturally to a local LLM (Ollama/LM Studio) or any cloud LLM. Real-time STT in, streaming tokens out, TTS reads the reply aloud (toggleable, default ON).

## Quick Start

### Installation

1. Download the latest release from the [releases page](https://github.com/NairoDorian/S2B2S/releases)
2. Install and grant microphone permissions
3. On first run, download **Parakeet V3** (~0.6 GB) — the default and recommended STT model
4. Configure your hotkeys and start transcribing!

### Development Setup

```bash
# Prerequisites: Rust, Bun
bun install
bun run tauri dev

# Build
bun run tauri build
```

For detailed build instructions, see [BUILD.md](BUILD.md).

## Architecture

S2B2S is built as a Tauri 2 application:

- **Frontend**: React + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS
- **Backend**: Rust for system integration, audio processing, and ML inference
- **Core Libraries**: transcribe-rs (Parakeet V3 + Whisper), cpal (audio I/O), vad-rs (Voice Activity Detection)

### Default STT Model: Parakeet V3

Parakeet TDT 0.6B V3 is the default and recommended STT engine:
- CPU-optimized, ~5x real-time on mid-range hardware
- 25 languages with automatic detection
- No GPU required (DirectML/CUDA optional for larger models)

### The Pipeline

```
Microphone → VAD (Silero) → Parakeet V3 STT → LLM Post-Processing (Brain) → Clipboard/Paste
                                                                           → TTS (Piper) Read Aloud
```

### CLI Parameters

```bash
s2b2s --toggle-transcription    # Toggle recording on/off
s2b2s --toggle-post-process     # Toggle with post-processing
s2b2s --cancel                  # Cancel current operation
s2b2s --start-hidden            # Start minimized to tray
s2b2s --no-tray                 # Start without tray icon
s2b2s --debug                   # Enable debug logging
```

## Platform Support

- **Windows 11** (primary)
- Windows 10, macOS, Linux

## Roadmap

S2B2S is the foundation of the SpeechToBrainToSpeech vision:

- **Now**: Full STT dictation with Parakeet V3 (from Handy base)
- **Next**: TTS read-aloud (Piper/Kokoro integration)
- **Then**: Conversation mode with local Brain (Ollama/LM Studio/llama.cpp streaming)
- **Later**: Multi-OS polish, streaming live captions, mobile companion

See the full planning documents in the `docs/` directory of the planning repository.

## Known Issues & Current Limitations

This project is actively being developed and has [known issues](https://github.com/NairoDorian/S2B2S/issues). We believe in transparency about the current state:

### Major Issues (Help Wanted)

**Whisper Model Crashes:**

- Whisper models crash on certain system configurations (Windows and Linux)
- Does not affect all systems - issue is configuration-dependent
  - If you experience crashes and are a developer, please help to fix and provide debug logs!

**Wayland Support (Linux):**

- Limited support for Wayland display server
- Requires [`wtype`](https://github.com/atx/wtype) or [`dotool`](https://sr.ht/~geb/dotool/) for text input to work correctly (see [Linux Notes](#linux-notes) below for installation)

### Linux Notes

**Text Input Tools:**

For reliable text input on Linux, install the appropriate tool for your display server:

| Display Server | Recommended Tool | Install Command                                    |
| -------------- | ---------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| X11            | `xdotool`        | `sudo apt install xdotool`                         |
| Wayland        | `wtype`          | `sudo apt install wtype`                           |
| Both           | `dotool`         | `sudo apt install dotool` (requires `input` group) |

- **X11**: Install `xdotool` for both direct typing and clipboard paste shortcuts
- **Wayland**: Install `wtype` (preferred) or `dotool` for text input to work correctly
- **dotool setup**: Requires adding your user to the `input` group: `sudo usermod -aG input $USER` (then log out and back in)

Without these tools, Handy falls back to enigo which may have limited compatibility, especially on Wayland.

**Other Notes:**

- **Runtime library dependency (`libgtk-layer-shell.so.0`)**:
  - Handy links `gtk-layer-shell` on Linux. If startup fails with `error while loading shared libraries: libgtk-layer-shell.so.0`, install the runtime package for your distro:

    | Distro        | Package to install    | Example command                        |
    | ------------- | --------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
    | Ubuntu/Debian | `libgtk-layer-shell0` | `sudo apt install libgtk-layer-shell0` |
    | Fedora/RHEL   | `gtk-layer-shell`     | `sudo dnf install gtk-layer-shell`     |
    | Arch Linux    | `gtk-layer-shell`     | `sudo pacman -S gtk-layer-shell`       |

  - For building from source on Ubuntu/Debian, you may also need `libgtk-layer-shell-dev`.

- The recording overlay is disabled by default on Linux (`Overlay Position: None`) because certain compositors treat it as the active window. When the overlay is visible it can steal focus, which prevents Handy from pasting back into the application that triggered transcription. If you enable the overlay anyway, be aware that clipboard-based pasting might fail or end up in the wrong window.
- If you are having trouble with the app, running with the environment variable `WEBKIT_DISABLE_DMABUF_RENDERER=1` may help
- If Handy fails to start reliably on Linux, see [Troubleshooting → Linux Startup Crashes or Instability](#linux-startup-crashes-or-instability).
- **Global keyboard shortcuts (Wayland):** On Wayland, system-level shortcuts must be configured through your desktop environment or window manager. Use the [CLI flags](#cli-parameters) as the command for your custom shortcut.

  **GNOME:**
  1. Open **Settings > Keyboard > Keyboard Shortcuts > Custom Shortcuts**
  2. Click the **+** button to add a new shortcut
  3. Set the **Name** to `Toggle Handy Transcription`
  4. Set the **Command** to `handy --toggle-transcription`
  5. Click **Set Shortcut** and press your desired key combination (e.g., `Super+O`)

  **KDE Plasma:**
  1. Open **System Settings > Shortcuts > Custom Shortcuts**
  2. Click **Edit > New > Global Shortcut > Command/URL**
  3. Name it `Toggle Handy Transcription`
  4. In the **Trigger** tab, set your desired key combination
  5. In the **Action** tab, set the command to `handy --toggle-transcription`

  **Sway / i3:**

  Add to your config file (`~/.config/sway/config` or `~/.config/i3/config`):

  ```ini
  bindsym $mod+o exec handy --toggle-transcription
  ```

  **Hyprland:**

  Add to your config file (`~/.config/hypr/hyprland.conf`):

  ```ini
  bind = $mainMod, O, exec, handy --toggle-transcription
  ```

- You can also manage global shortcuts outside of Handy via Unix signals, which lets Wayland window managers or other hotkey daemons keep ownership of keybindings:

  | Signal    | Action                                    | Example                |
  | --------- | ----------------------------------------- | ---------------------- |
  | `SIGUSR2` | Toggle transcription                      | `pkill -USR2 -n handy` |
  | `SIGUSR1` | Toggle transcription with post-processing | `pkill -USR1 -n handy` |

  Example Sway config:

  ```ini
  bindsym $mod+o exec pkill -USR2 -n handy
  bindsym $mod+p exec pkill -USR1 -n handy
  ```

  `pkill` here simply delivers the signal—it does not terminate the process.

**Overlay & Pasting Issues (Linux):**

- The recording overlay window can interfere with pasting transcribed text into target applications on Linux (X11)
- **Solution:** Open **Settings > Advanced** and set **"Overlay Position"** to **"None"** to disable the overlay
- Enable **"Audio Feedback"** (also in Advanced) if you still want audible confirmation of recording state
- Users who upgrade from older versions or import settings from other platforms may need to manually apply this change

### Platform Support

- **macOS (both Intel and Apple Silicon)**
- **x64 Windows**
- **x64 Linux**

### System Requirements/Recommendations

The following are recommendations for running Handy on your own machine. If you don't meet the system requirements, the performance of the application may be degraded. We are working on improving the performance across all kinds of computers and hardware.

**For Whisper Models:**

- **macOS**: M series Mac, Intel Mac
- **Windows**: Intel, AMD, or NVIDIA GPU
- **Linux**: Intel, AMD, or NVIDIA GPU
  - Ubuntu 22.04, 24.04

**For Parakeet V3 Model:**

- **CPU-only operation** - runs on a wide variety of hardware
- **Minimum**: Intel Skylake (6th gen) or equivalent AMD processors
- **Performance**: ~5x real-time speed on mid-range hardware (tested on i5)
- **Automatic language detection** - no manual language selection required

## Roadmap & Active Development

We're actively working on several features and improvements. Contributions and feedback are welcome!

### In Progress

**Debug Logging:**

- Adding debug logging to a file to help diagnose issues

**macOS Keyboard Improvements:**

- Support for Globe key as transcription trigger
- A rewrite of global shortcut handling for MacOS, and potentially other OS's too.

**Opt-in Analytics:**

- Collect anonymous usage data to help improve Handy
- Privacy-first approach with clear opt-in

**Settings Refactoring:**

- Cleanup and refactor settings system which is becoming bloated and messy
- Implement better abstractions for settings management

**Tauri Commands Cleanup:**

- Abstract and organize Tauri command patterns
- Investigate tauri-specta for improved type safety and organization

## Verify Release Signatures

Handy release artifacts are signed with Tauri's updater signature format. The public key is stored in [`src-tauri/tauri.conf.json`](src-tauri/tauri.conf.json) under `plugins.updater.pubkey`.

To verify a release manually, set `ARTIFACT` to the filename you downloaded, save the `pubkey` value from `src-tauri/tauri.conf.json` to `handy.pub.b64`, then decode the public key and matching `.sig` file from base64 and verify the artifact with `minisign`:

```bash
# Replace with the file you downloaded
ARTIFACT="Handy_0.8.1_amd64.AppImage"

python3 - "$ARTIFACT" <<'PY'
import base64, pathlib, sys

artifact = sys.argv[1]

pub = pathlib.Path("handy.pub.b64").read_text().strip()
pathlib.Path("handy.pub").write_bytes(base64.b64decode(pub))

sig = pathlib.Path(f"{artifact}.sig").read_text().strip()
pathlib.Path(f"{artifact}.minisig").write_bytes(base64.b64decode(sig))
PY

minisign -Vm "$ARTIFACT" \
  -p handy.pub \
  -x "$ARTIFACT.minisig"
```

On success, `minisign` prints:

```text
Signature and comment signature verified
```

Do not use `gpg` for these `.sig` files.

## Troubleshooting

### Manual Model Installation (For Proxy Users or Network Restrictions)

If you're behind a proxy, firewall, or in a restricted network environment where Handy cannot download models automatically, you can manually download and install them. The URLs are publicly accessible from any browser.

#### Step 1: Find Your App Data Directory

1. Open Handy settings
2. Navigate to the **About** section
3. Copy the "App Data Directory" path shown there, or use the shortcuts:
   - **macOS**: `Cmd+Shift+D` to open debug menu
   - **Windows/Linux**: `Ctrl+Shift+D` to open debug menu

The typical paths are:

- **macOS**: `~/Library/Application Support/com.pais.handy/`
- **Windows**: `C:\Users\{username}\AppData\Roaming\com.pais.handy\`
- **Linux**: `~/.config/com.pais.handy/`

#### Step 2: Create Models Directory

Inside your app data directory, create a `models` folder if it doesn't already exist:

```bash
# macOS/Linux
mkdir -p ~/Library/Application\ Support/com.pais.handy/models

# Windows (PowerShell)
New-Item -ItemType Directory -Force -Path "$env:APPDATA\com.pais.handy\models"
```

#### Step 3: Download Model Files

Download the models you want from below

**Whisper Models (single .bin files):**

- Small (487 MB): `https://blob.handy.computer/ggml-small.bin`
- Medium (492 MB): `https://blob.handy.computer/whisper-medium-q4_1.bin`
- Turbo (1600 MB): `https://blob.handy.computer/ggml-large-v3-turbo.bin`
- Large (1100 MB): `https://blob.handy.computer/ggml-large-v3-q5_0.bin`

**Parakeet Models (compressed archives):**

- V2 (473 MB): `https://blob.handy.computer/parakeet-v2-int8.tar.gz`
- V3 (478 MB): `https://blob.handy.computer/parakeet-v3-int8.tar.gz`

#### Step 4: Install Models

**For Whisper Models (.bin files):**

Simply place the `.bin` file directly into the `models` directory:

```
{app_data_dir}/models/
├── ggml-small.bin
├── whisper-medium-q4_1.bin
├── ggml-large-v3-turbo.bin
└── ggml-large-v3-q5_0.bin
```

**For Parakeet Models (.tar.gz archives):**

1. Extract the `.tar.gz` file
2. Place the **extracted directory** into the `models` folder
3. The directory must be named exactly as follows:
   - **Parakeet V2**: `parakeet-tdt-0.6b-v2-int8`
   - **Parakeet V3**: `parakeet-tdt-0.6b-v3-int8`

Final structure should look like:

```
{app_data_dir}/models/
├── parakeet-tdt-0.6b-v2-int8/     (directory with model files inside)
│   ├── (model files)
│   └── (config files)
└── parakeet-tdt-0.6b-v3-int8/     (directory with model files inside)
    ├── (model files)
    └── (config files)
```

**Important Notes:**

- For Parakeet models, the extracted directory name **must** match exactly as shown above
- Do not rename the `.bin` files for Whisper models—use the exact filenames from the download URLs
- After placing the files, restart Handy to detect the new models

#### Step 5: Verify Installation

1. Restart Handy
2. Open Settings → Models
3. Your manually installed models should now appear as "Downloaded"
4. Select the model you want to use and test transcription

### Custom Whisper Models

Handy can auto-discover custom Whisper GGML models placed in the `models` directory. This is useful for users who want to use fine-tuned or community models not included in the default model list.

**How to use:**

1. Obtain a Whisper model in GGML `.bin` format (e.g., from [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/models?search=whisper%20ggml))
2. Place the `.bin` file in your `models` directory (see paths above)
3. Restart Handy to discover the new model
4. The model will appear in the "Custom Models" section of the Models settings page

**Important:**

- Community models are user-provided and may not receive troubleshooting assistance
- The model must be a valid Whisper GGML format (`.bin` file)
- Model name is derived from the filename (e.g., `my-custom-model.bin` → "My Custom Model")

### Linux Startup Crashes or Instability

If Handy fails to start reliably on Linux — for example, it crashes shortly after launch, never shows its window, or reports a Wayland protocol error — try the steps below in order.

**1. Install (or reinstall) `gtk-layer-shell`**

Handy uses `gtk-layer-shell` for its recording overlay and links against it at runtime. A missing or broken installation is the most common cause of startup failures and can manifest as a crash or a hang well before any window is shown. Make sure the runtime package is installed for your distro:

| Distro        | Package to install    | Example command                        |
| ------------- | --------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| Ubuntu/Debian | `libgtk-layer-shell0` | `sudo apt install libgtk-layer-shell0` |
| Fedora/RHEL   | `gtk-layer-shell`     | `sudo dnf install gtk-layer-shell`     |
| Arch Linux    | `gtk-layer-shell`     | `sudo pacman -S gtk-layer-shell`       |

If it is already installed and you still see startup problems, try reinstalling it (e.g. `sudo pacman -S gtk-layer-shell` again) in case the library files were corrupted by a partial upgrade.

**2. Disable the GTK layer shell overlay (`HANDY_NO_GTK_LAYER_SHELL`)**

If installing the library does not help, you can skip `gtk-layer-shell` initialization entirely as a workaround. On some compositors (notably KDE Plasma under Wayland) it has been reported to interact poorly with the recording overlay. With this variable set, the overlay falls back to a regular always-on-top window:

```bash
HANDY_NO_GTK_LAYER_SHELL=1 handy
```

**3. Disable WebKit DMA-BUF renderer (`WEBKIT_DISABLE_DMABUF_RENDERER`)**

On some GPU/driver combinations the WebKitGTK DMA-BUF renderer can cause the window to fail to render or to crash. Try:

```bash
WEBKIT_DISABLE_DMABUF_RENDERER=1 handy
```

**Making a workaround permanent**

Once you've found a flag that helps, export it from your shell profile (`~/.bashrc`, `~/.zshenv`, …) or from the desktop autostart entry that launches Handy. If you launch Handy from a `.desktop` file, you can prefix the `Exec=` line, e.g.:

```ini
Exec=env HANDY_NO_GTK_LAYER_SHELL=1 handy
```

If a workaround helps you, please [open an issue](https://github.com/cjpais/Handy/issues) describing your distro, desktop environment, and session type — that information helps us narrow down the underlying bug.
